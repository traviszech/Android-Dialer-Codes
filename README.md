# 📱 Android Secret Codes (MMI/USSD/Dialer Codes) Master List

A continuously curated, comprehensive archive of hidden **MMI (Man-Machine Interface)** and **USSD codes** for Android devices, including manufacturer-specific diagnostics, hidden service menus, and deep system controls.

The codes listed are primarily **MMI codes** (processed locally for menus) or **Supplementary Service codes** (standard call features).

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNINGS & DISCLAIMER

### 🛑 Safety First: Use With Caution
Some codes will reboot your phone, reset network configurations, or access secure hardware menus. **Do not execute any code you do not fully understand.**

### 📝 Code Syntax Variations
**IMPORTANT:** Due to firmware, carrier, and model variations, the exact code format required can change. If a code fails, **try these variations**:

| If Listed As: | Try This Variation: |
| :--- | :--- |
| `*#XXXX#` | `*#*#XXXX#*#*` |
| `*#*#XXXX#*#*` | `*#XXXX#` |
